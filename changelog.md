v0.1.2
---

- Added functionality for spin dependent (two component) wave functions!
  - Automatically detect whether input DFT data has spin dependence.
  - Valence -> conduction transition rates can be computed with spin dependent wave functions.
  - Added example input file for Si which has spin dependent wave functions.

v0.1.1
---

- When timer = .TRUE. a smaller version of the program will be run before the main program, and an estimate of the run time of the full program will be printed.
- Improved output printing.
- Updated Si example input files to use file paths relative to the main folder.

v0.1.0
---

- Initial beta release.

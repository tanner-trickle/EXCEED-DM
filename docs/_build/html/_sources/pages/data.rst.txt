Electronic Configuration Files
==============================

While the :code:`examples` folder contains many example electronic configuration files useful for testing and learning what :code:`EXCEED-DM` can do, they are not suitable for publication quality results. The datasets are simply too small; they do no adequately represent the collection of electronic states in the target. The publication quality electronic configuration files are too big to host on the Github repository, typically being :math:`\mathcal{O}(\text{GB})` in size. There are two ways around this: 

1) Create your own electronic configuration file to the specifications given in :doc:`File Specifications - Electronic Configuration File </pages/file_spec/elec_config>`. This is the best option if you are studying a novel target.
2) Use a publicly available electronic configuration file. The files for Si and Ge are hosted on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_, with links given below. It is **highly recommeded** that you make your electronic configuration files public so that results can be easily reproduced.

.. note:: Remember to cite the associated reference if you use these publically available electronic configuration files.

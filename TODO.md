# TODO

## Short term

- See if incorporating external BLAS software gives significant speed increase.
- Use better profiling to see if there are slow spots.
- Spin dependent wave functions in c -> c, c -> f, v -> f calculations.
- Add testing routines.

## Long term

- Use target symmetries to simplify the calculation (?).

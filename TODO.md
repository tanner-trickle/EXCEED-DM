# TODO

## Short term

- Spin dependent wave function implementation in 
  - c -> c calculation
  - c -> f calculation
  - v -> f calculation
- Spin dependent responses in 
  - c -> c calculation
  - c -> f calculation
  - v -> f calculation
- add tests for dielectric calculation

### Optimization

- Use better profiling to see if there are slow spots.

## Long term

- Use target symmetries to simplify the calculation (?).

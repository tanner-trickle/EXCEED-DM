# Example 4: Si Binned Scatter Rate, core to free

- Calculation: Binned scatter rate

- Target: Si

Core to free transitions in Si. Core states are identical to example 2; STO basis for $1 \leq n \leq 2$. Free states are identical to example 3; $p$ log-uniformly sampled on a 10 point grid between [60, 120] $\mathrm{eV}$, and $\theta_\mathbf{p}, \phi_\mathbf{p}$ uniformly sampled on a sphere with $4 \times 4$ points.

Additionally we assume $Z_\mathrm{eff} = 1$.

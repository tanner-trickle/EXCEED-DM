- Target: Si

- Process: absorption

- Description: Spin dependent pseudoscalar DM absorption rate via valence to conduction transitions. Computed with \( \Pi_{ \mathbf{v} \cdot \sigma, \mathbf{v} \cdot \sigma} \) operator, which reduces to \( \Pi_{ \mathbf{v}^i, \mathbf{v}^i } \) computed in example 12. Since the Si wave functions have been artificially extended the results of this example are identical to example 12.

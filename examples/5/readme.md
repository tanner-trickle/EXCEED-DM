# Example 5: Si Binned Scatter Rate, All Transitions Included

- Calculation: Binned scatter rate

- Target: Si

Complete calculation of transition rates in Si. Initial electronic states are a combination of the valence and core states from examples 1 and 2. Final electronic states are a combination of the conduction and free states from examples 2 and 3. See those example `readme`'s for more details.

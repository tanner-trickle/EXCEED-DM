### Example 14: Si Binned Scatter Rate, valence to conduction

- Calculation: Binned scatter rate

- Target: Si

Valence to conduction transitions in Si using an example $2 \times 2 \times 2$ $\mathbf{k}$-mesh. Wave function coefficients have been doubled to produce artifical "spin dependent" wave functions. Scattering rate is determined by the 'SD' operator and the results will be idential to Example 1 (by construction). Useful for timing this section of the whole calculation.

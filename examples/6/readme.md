# Example 6: Si Axion Absorption Rate, valence to conduction

- Calculation: Absorption rate

- Target: Si

Absorption rate of an axion-like particle, for two $\delta$: $\delta = 1 \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $\delta = 0.2 + 10^{-1} \omega$. Only valence to conduction transitions are included.

```{note}
This electronic state configuration is identical to Example 1.

## ID: 7

- Target: Si

- Process: scattering

- Description: Spin independent core to conduction transition from \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \), where \( n\) is the principal quantum number, to the lowest conduction band. Extended to kinematic boundary by performing the calculation in different manner than example #6. Disadvantage is slow run time. Single dark matter mass and form factor.

# Example 11: Si Dielectric

- Calculation: Dielectric

- Target: Si

Compute the (averaged) dielectric, $\bar{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{q}, \omega)$, of Si.

```{note}
This electronic configuration is the same as Example 5.

```{warning}
The transition form factors used in this calculation are **not** in the $q \rightarrow 0$ limit. This is appropriate for screening scattering rate calculations, but not for absorption calculations which, sometimes, may be written in terms of the long wavelength dielectric, $\varepsilon(\mathbf{q} \rightarrow 0, \omega)$.

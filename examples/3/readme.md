### Example 3: Si Binned Scatter Rate, valence to free

- Calculation: Binned scatter rate

- Target: Si

Valence to free transitions in Si. Valence states are identical to example 1; PW basis on a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ $\mathbf{k}$-mesh. Free states have $p$ log-uniformly sampled on a 10 point grid between [60, 120] $\mathrm{eV}$, and $\theta_\mathbf{p}, \phi_\mathbf{p}$ uniformly sampled on a sphere with $4 \times 4$ points.

Additionally we assume $Z_\mathrm{eff} = 1$.

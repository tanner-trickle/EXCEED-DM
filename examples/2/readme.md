### Example 2: Si Binned Scatter Rate, core to conduction

- Calculation: Binned scatter rate

- Target: Si

Core to conduction transitions in Si. Core states are RHF wave functions with $1 \leq n \leq 2$ in an STO basis. Conduction states are the same as in example 1; PW basis wave functions on a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ $\mathbf{k}$-mesh.
